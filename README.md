# line-pattern
HTML5 / JavaScript Practice

An early project created to practice JavaScript and HTML. Uses HTML5 canvas to draw a set of lines which create a pattern over time.

While this project is simple, it's entertaining to look at. Resizing the window will result in entirely different patterns. Reloading the page will generate new random colors. For even more control, you can modify the constants at the top of `main.js`.
